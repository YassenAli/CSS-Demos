# CSS Demos

This repository contains various CSS examples created during my learning journey at the Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence, Cairo University, in the Web Technology course.


These files cover the basics of CSS, including styling elements, layout techniques, responsive design, and typography. You can include these CSS files in your HTML demos to illustrate how CSS can be used to enhance the appearance and layout of web pages.
